More or less, these\npolicies were focused on program-level minimum criteria, such as qualification, entry test,\nCGPA, CH, coursework, publication, dissertation, supervisory load and criteria, and faculty\nrequirements. Meanwhile, HEC also issued several supplementary notifications elaborating the\ngiven criteria in pieces. Despite this, the worth of graduate education has always been a matter\nof concern. Lastly, HEC issued its policy on PhD Program in 2021; however, it received little\nsupport from the academia across the country due to disagreement with several aspects of the\npolicy. Many felt that the policy was too focused on coursework and not on research. Despite\nextensive discussions at the institutional level, various VC forums, and technical experts'\ncommittees, a consensus could not be developed. Learning through the experience, the\nChairman HEC decided to review the policy afresh through feedback from the entire academia. As a result, the HEC introduced the revised Graduate Education Policy-2023 (GEP-2023). 2. In line with its name, GEP-2023 encompasses all the minimum standards and\nguidelines to impart Level 7 and 8 qualifications, with a special emphasis on governance of the\ndoctoral research system in HEIs and quality assurance, while all the previous policies,\nincluding the PhD Policy 2021, focused merely on program-level requirements. Accordingly,\nthe revised policy, while addressing the concerns of the stakeholders regarding admission and\nCredit Hours requirements, also embarks on various aspects of a quality dissertation along with\nresearch ethics, the roles and responsibilities of research supervisors and supervisees, and the\nconditions regulating their relationship and the handling of grievances. 3.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"f3dd3386-5ba5-4c66-8409-4b684d45e169":{"id_":"f3dd3386-5ba5-4c66-8409-4b684d45e169","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Graduate-Education-Policy- 2023.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"j7PMYa8XvkG/Etr+tr+rXEicL7wUcPjs2g2kcddanbM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"5b0ac342-a366-4074-a1da-4c99b547034a","metadata":{},"hash":"W8Bepbx8jEb9j7A2jFQF6FSNkyjgH0T4PyWrEUQ57RI="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"36a46f67-996a-4275-aa4b-0464fa73a8cd","metadata":{},"hash":"IqZqkZ8MtcC0YU4RxiEmnL9lzUb57iHlOr7d+fKHziw="}},"hash":"70uG7317pnmBWnI8pbcNY6uPh7QKeMa3XMq1p0I2sp0=","text":"3. Further, the new policy, while appreciating university autonomy within the ambit of\ntheir charters/acts, seeks to strike the right balance between autonomy and regulatory\nconstraints. Hence, the requirement of obtaining NOC for the launch of a new graduate\nprogram has been relaxed for the top HEIs, ranked through a system as may be prescribed,\nwhile the lower-ranked HEIs must seek HEC’s NOC. However, these HEIs can exercise their\nautonomy in determining faculty relevance at their end by adopting the mechanism prescribed\nin the policy. Lastly, this policy also suggests retributive actions for the HEIs violating the\nprovisions that it prescribes. 4. Overall, the policy has three parts: (i) Minimum Standards and Guidelines for\nLaunching a Program and Awarding Degrees, Part-I; (ii) Governance of Doctoral Research\nSystem, Part-II; and (iii) Quality Assurance, Part-III. v | P a g e\nPURPOSE\nDoctor of Philosophy (or PhD) is the highest university degree, awarded in most\ndisciplines. Those who qualify at this level, are expected to serve highly consequential\nfunctions in the society, including in the fields of teaching and research. With in-depth training\nand immersion in a particular field of study, which includes making an original contribution to\nthe area of study through the PhD dissertation, those holding PhD degrees are expected to have\nexpertise in their area of study that they can utilize in teaching and further research, as well as\nin problem-solving and innovation to address important societal challenges. While other degree\nprograms aim to teach students the things that we (the academic community) know, the purpose\nof a PhD program is to enable students to investigate what we do not know. 2. In view of the highly consequential functions served by PhD degree holders, one of the\nmost important guiding principles of the HEC’s Graduate Education Policy is quality. Hence,\nthe policy is intended to ensure that PhD programs are open only to individuals, who carry a\npassion for, and deep interest in, academics and research, and who have demonstrated that they\ncan handle the academic rigor required to complete a PhD degree. The overall goal of this\npolicy is that PhD graduates from Pakistani universities should possess expertise in their field\nof study, be able to conduct high-quality research, and have strong scholarly writing skills\nrelevant to their field of study.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"36a46f67-996a-4275-aa4b-0464fa73a8cd":{"id_":"36a46f67-996a-4275-aa4b-0464fa73a8cd","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Graduate-Education-Policy- 2023.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"j7PMYa8XvkG/Etr+tr+rXEicL7wUcPjs2g2kcddanbM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f3dd3386-5ba5-4c66-8409-4b684d45e169","metadata":{},"hash":"70uG7317pnmBWnI8pbcNY6uPh7QKeMa3XMq1p0I2sp0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"78f06138-e1d3-4cbb-a752-f7f65e8455ab","metadata":{},"hash":"Jg/td8XBnPKIM5j/vVk+X7VPst75DRdVxAj3hACSOrg="}},"hash":"IqZqkZ8MtcC0YU4RxiEmnL9lzUb57iHlOr7d+fKHziw=","text":"Therefore, it may be preferable to not confer a PhD degree than\nto confer a PhD degree based on substandard academic and research work. 3. Since the PhD is a highly specialized degree, it is intended that only higher education\ninstitutions (HEIs) that possess resources to offer quality education at the highest level should\noffer PhD degree programs. The HEC has prescribed standards for launching PhD programs,\nand universities must obtain HEC approval by submitting evidence of compliance with these\nstandards before launching a PhD program. However, it is critical to note that the prescribed\nstandards are the minimum that every PhD candidate must satisfy before being awarded a\ndegree. Universities are encouraged to formulate their own admission and completion\nrequirements that would further enhance the quality of their PhD programs, provided that such\ninternal policies are consistent with the minimum requirements set forth by the HEC. MANDATE\nThis policy has been made pursuant to the powers granted to the HEC under the Higher\nEducation Commission Ordinance, 2002, and is binding on all HEIs in the country, whether\noperating in the public or private sector. Violations or failure to comply with HEC policies\nmay lead to regulatory action being taken against non-compliant HEIs including, but not\nlimited to, issuance of warnings, direction to stop further admissions, suspension or\ncancellation of NOCs, issuance of public alerts, and non-recognition of deficient degrees.

PRACTICING THE ACADEMIC RESEARCH ETHICS\n5.1 Principles and Purposes\nThe International Center for Academic Integrity\n16 \n(2022) defines Academic Integrity as\n“commitment, even in the face of adversity, to six fundamental values: honesty, trust,\nfairness, respect, responsibility, and courage. From these values flow principles of behavior\nthat enable academic communities to translate ideals into action. ”\nThus, the main purpose of this section is to guide academics on how to put these core values\ninto practice in universities/HEIs/DAIs, so that academic communities can be protected by\npreventing academic misconduct. However, it may be noted that these guidelines are not\nbinding, but rather prescriptive in nature. In this regard, the main regulatory framework to\nprevent academic misconduct lies with the Anti-Plagiarism policy issued by the Higher\nEducation Commission, Pakistan. 5.2 Guidelines to Ensure Academic Research Integrity\n17\n:\nTo inculcate a culture of academic integrity, the universities/HEIs/DAIs shall:\ni. Develop/adopt/adapt and regularly publicize policies promoting academic integrity\nand dealing with allegations of academic misconduct. ii.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"ce97c48d-1bfd-460b-bc1a-5fdbfb55fcd3":{"id_":"ce97c48d-1bfd-460b-bc1a-5fdbfb55fcd3","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/Graduate-Education-Policy- 2023.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"j7PMYa8XvkG/Etr+tr+rXEicL7wUcPjs2g2kcddanbM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"28ae32af-40eb-4c49-8b75-82ff8ae295c7","metadata":{},"hash":"uMT/PYFgk2gyPa/CxM8h5R4ANpcKNqsbF43nc9p5nLw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"9d3cd04d-9f1c-44e1-90a7-77d6d81de563","metadata":{},"hash":"gwma5Ehi4hLyMXHHcHcsOxHYba2w+Q97+s7dzAQJLRI="}},"hash":"2nBP5GQw7sUIDWgz93Cf5cVpeqG3A7eBMAJd3VK/VJ0=","text":"ii.

Common phrases and proper nouns also appear as similarities in the report;\ntherefore, every instructor or faculty member should ignore the matches returned\nfrom them. viii. The originality report will show similarities from three major sources: the Internet,\nperiodicals, and student repositories. Similarities returned from the student\nrepository may be ignored if they are the author's own work. Similarities from the\nstudent repository help in detecting collusions in the documents. ix.

INTRODUCTION\nCentral Library of University of Haripur has always been striving hard to meet the\nexpectations of its users. However, there has been a long felt need to bring clarity\nand uniformity in procedures and practices of the library so as to further improve its\nefficiency, utility, services and productivity. For that very reason library must have\nan operational Policy where all rules, regulations, procedures are clearly spelt out. An initial draft of the “Policy” has been prepared by consulting similar documents of\nthe country renowned libraries of various universities. LIBRARY POLICY\nThis “Library Policy / Statutes” aims upon all important functional modules of the\nlibrary and outline a clear policy as to how the activities of the library be\nstreamlined and maintained like collection development, provision of information\nservices and management of other relevant academic & research support facilities. This will bring uniformity in networking with our libraries which will be coming up in\ndifferent departments / campuses. For the effective implementation of this “Policy”,\napproval is needed from the University’s authorities / bodies. This “Library Policy” is a source of information, even a constitution which lists out\nall departments, sections and officials and their functions, policies & procedures /\nrules & regulations within the library. This will be the source that library staff will\nconsult whenever there is any confusion about any function or procedure. This\nneeds series of meetings with all stakeholders recommend the final draft with\nconsensus as the policy for final approval of authorities / bodies. ROLE OF LIBRARY IN ACADEMIA\nLibrary plays a very significant role in supporting the academic & research\nprograms of the academia. It is library that identifies, evaluates, acquires,\nprocesses and then makes these learning resources available in well-systematic\norder to the users for their teaching, learning and research assignments.

This would also resolve other management issues. iv. One can enforce terms to the publishers/vendors in form of the pricing,\naccess to the back volumes, locking period, perpetual access, archival\nrights, governing laws, training and awareness program, immunity, access\nto the walk-in-users, usage statistics, simultaneous access, etc. v.

LOSS OF PUBLICATIONS\n Some loss of publications is inevitable especially in the context of open\naccess practice in libraries. The librarian has a role as information manager\nand not just a custodian. Therefore he/she should not be held responsible\nfor the losses.  Loss of 5 volumes per 1000 volumes issued and/or consulted in a year may\nbe taken as reasonable.  Loss of a book of the value exceeding Rs.2000.00 for books published in\nPakistan and Rs.10,000.00 for books published abroad and books of special\nnature and rarity shall invariably be investigated and consequential action\ntaken.

PRINCIPLES AND PURPOSES OF THE POLICY\n1.1. Higher Education Institutions (“HEIs”) are highly consequential institutions in\nsociety that are dedicated to the pursuit and dissemination of knowledge. Members of the HEI community have several important rights and privileges,\ncentral among which is the right to pursue inquiry and search for knowledge\nwithout hinderance from unlawful or otherwise unacceptable constraints.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"f4bf8868-26f7-4855-96cb-bd726ea29c48":{"id_":"f4bf8868-26f7-4855-96cb-bd726ea29c48","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/uoh-Policy-Protection-Sexual-Harassment.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"240Zil/mZVq/dLLD63yeJZM7oQax6uahob8mzAJmjqs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"c09cd453-3a6c-4968-9ecb-4c85a695e044","metadata":{},"hash":"c06P6Qf6CinNqRp74ktuQA4JgqoFIm0xL9x9uLktFGk="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"72b49f9b-f8e0-4f50-b812-342bdaa6e387","metadata":{},"hash":"iUJSmDCfkggg+DfN6/01yrvSfsohbf48OHIHF/tNoco="}},"hash":"0ljt27QE6P7NJ4Imn4Rdggh4eqGA+iETNPaQlIxFYtc=","text":"The\nHigher Education Commission (the “HEC”), which has been mandated by law to\nprescribe conditions under which HEIs in the country may be opened and\noperated, takes very seriously the freedom of teachers, researchers, scholars,\nstudents and other members of the HEI community to live and work in a safe\nenvironment in which their dignity is protected. 1.2. Protection against sexual harassment is important not only because it threatens\nthe freedom and conduciveness of the environment at institutions of higher\nlearning. At a more fundamental level, such conduct is unacceptable because it\nviolates personal dignity and shall not be tolerated at HEIs in Pakistan under\nany circumstance. 1.3. In accordance with the terms of this policy, sexual harassment shall be\nprohibited at HEIs in Pakistan, and shall constitute a punishable offence under\nthe policy. The HEC affirms the right of every member of the HEI community\nlive, study and work in an environment that is free from sexual harassment. The\ngoal of this policy is to prevent sexual harassment from taking place, and where\nnecessary to act upon complaints of sexual harassment promptly, fairly,\njudiciously and with due regard to confidentiality for all parties concerned. 1.4. All administrators, deans, managers, faculty, department chairs, directors of\nschools or programs and others in supervisory or leadership positions have an\nobligation to be familiar with and to uphold this policy and its procedures along\nwith informing members of their staff about its existence. HEIs are encouraged\nto formulate internal policies that further strengthen or expand the protections\navailable under the HEC’s policy on sexual harassment. 1.5. This policy has been made pursuant to the powers granted to the HEC under the\nHigher Education Commission Ordinance, 2002, and is binding on all higher\neducation institutions in the country, whether operating in the public or private\nsectors. Violations or failure to comply with the HEC’s policies may lead to\nregulatory action being taken against non-compliant HEIs. 1.6. This policy is consistent with and has been made in light of the provisions of the\nProtection Against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act 2010 (as\namended) (the “2010 Harassment Act”).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"72b49f9b-f8e0-4f50-b812-342bdaa6e387":{"id_":"72b49f9b-f8e0-4f50-b812-342bdaa6e387","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/uoh-Policy-Protection-Sexual-Harassment.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"240Zil/mZVq/dLLD63yeJZM7oQax6uahob8mzAJmjqs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f4bf8868-26f7-4855-96cb-bd726ea29c48","metadata":{},"hash":"0ljt27QE6P7NJ4Imn4Rdggh4eqGA+iETNPaQlIxFYtc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"4307eb13-303d-40f1-a15e-13a554c75908","metadata":{},"hash":"0pzDhLBlHJv9cOxr6apNT7G1hsQdGs8eRPnWfiFfDQ8="}},"hash":"iUJSmDCfkggg+DfN6/01yrvSfsohbf48OHIHF/tNoco=","text":"It extends the protection against\nsexual harassment to all members of the HEI community, and provides the\noption to aggrieved persons to seek recourse to resources within the HEI or to\nseek redressal through the provisions of the 2010 Act. 4\n2. PROHIBITED CONDUCT\n2.1. “Sexual harassment” means any unwelcome sexual advance, request for sexual\nfavors or other verbal or written communication or physical conduct of a sexual\nnature, or sexually demeaning attitudes, where:\na) Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term\nor condition of an individual participation in any activity at the HEI;\nb) Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as a\nbasis for academic or employment decision affecting that individual; or\nc) Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with\nan individual’s academic or work performance, or of creating an\nintimidating, hostile, or offensive educational or working environment. 2.2. Sexual harassment may be overt or subtle, and can range from visual signals or\ngestures to verbal abuse to physical contact along with hand or sign language to\ndenote sexual activity, persistent and unwelcome flirting (see Annex 1 for\nexamples of various manifestations). 2.3. The following behaviors are specifically prohibited under this policy. This\nfollowing are meant to provide specificity to the definition provided in clauses\n2.1. However, it is not an exhaustive list, and other behaviors that fall within the\nscope of the definition above shall also be prohibited. a) Especially Egregious Non-Consensual Acts: Acts that would be included\nin the category of rape. While such situations will be covered under the\nlaws of the country, and law enforcement institutions and the courts will\ninvestigate and adjudicate accordingly, the HEI administration has a\nspecial obligation to take preventative measures, offer immediate\nassistance and take interim measures when required. b) Non-Consensual Sexual Contact: Includes sexual contact with another\nperson without consent. c) Sexual Exploitation: Taking of actions that violate the sexual privacy of\nothers or taking sexual advantage of another without their consent. For\nexample, taking pictures, videotaping, viewing or distributing explicit\nimages or sexual information of another person without their consent.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"4307eb13-303d-40f1-a15e-13a554c75908":{"id_":"4307eb13-303d-40f1-a15e-13a554c75908","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/uoh-Policy-Protection-Sexual-Harassment.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"240Zil/mZVq/dLLD63yeJZM7oQax6uahob8mzAJmjqs="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"72b49f9b-f8e0-4f50-b812-342bdaa6e387","metadata":{},"hash":"iUJSmDCfkggg+DfN6/01yrvSfsohbf48OHIHF/tNoco="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"5715af4c-0313-4f43-b6ba-5ec0caa827e8","metadata":{},"hash":"myIx8xNNveiKvpicTrhWLbZwi0gudGewe5m+83nluVQ="}},"hash":"0pzDhLBlHJv9cOxr6apNT7G1hsQdGs8eRPnWfiFfDQ8=","text":"d) Other Pervasive or Severe Behaviors: It is not necessary that there be\nactual sexual contact for a behavior to be categorized as sexual\nharassment. Other unwelcome behaviors are also prohibited if (i) they are\nbased on an individual’s sex or gender (ii) are persistent or highly serious\nand (iii) create an atmosphere which is intimidating or hostile. These\ninclude but are not limited to lewd remarks or gestures, highly offensive\njokes of a sexual nature, commenting inappropriately about another’s\nbody, and stalking. e) Sex Discrimination: Adverse treatment of individuals based on their sex\nor gender rather than on merit. This would include instances such as the\nsingling out (for such adverse treatment as lower salary or grades, or\nmore severe punishment) of person(s) on the basis of sex or gender. 5\n2.4. All the actions categorized as sexual harassment when done physically or\nverbally would also be considered as sexual harassment when done\nelectronically such as through the internet, e- mails, social media, texting,\ntelephone, voicemail etc. 2.5. All actions of harassment or discrimination may be taken by a person of any\ngender against a person of the same or another gender, and would need to be\nconsidered by the HEI if the act qualifies as a prohibited act under the policy. 2.6. Sexual harassment is especially offensive when perpetrated by persons in\nauthority, and when submission is made a condition toward any HEI activity or\nbenefit (for example, when submission is made the basis of the evaluation of an\nindividual). 2.7. Sexual harassment will be considered especially egregious when the accused\nknew or reasonably should have known that the victim was in an impaired or\nincapacitated state. However, impairment of the accused, such as a result of the\nuse of any illegal substances, shall not diminish their responsibility for\nharassment under this policy. 3. JURISDICTION\n3.1.
